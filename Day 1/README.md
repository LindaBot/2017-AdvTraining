Conversations as a Platform (CaaP) is the idea that humans and technology will reach the point where we can hold normal, genuine conversations with technology to elicit or work together to achieve more. Imagine being able to order Pizza through natural language, or work with your laptop as a real assistant, instead of a machine. With Microsoft's existing technology, we are close - many companies are already leveraging the concept of CaaP to give their customers a better, faster and more human experience.

# ChatBots

Chatbots is one of the implementations of CaaP.
