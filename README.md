# Day 0

This is work that needs to be completed prior to Advanced Training.

If you can brush up on NodeJS as well, it will be very helpful.

# Day 1

We will teach you all about Conversations as a Platform and you will build your first chatbot. We'll also recap Custom Vision, LUIS and other relevant things. We will be using NodeJS.

# Day 2

We'll introduce Databases, EasyTables, APIs and cover concepts such as testing, source control, security, BA skills and soft skills.

# Day 3

We will cover advanced matters such as integration with a website, and finish up our demo bot.
