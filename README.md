# AdvTraining
The official repository and source of knowledge for MSA students taking part in MSA 2017.

This is work that needs to be completed prior to Advanced Training.

If you can brush up on NodeJS as well, it will be very helpful.

# Day 1

We will teach you all about Conversations as a Platform and you will build your first chatbot. We'll also recap Custom Vision, LUIS and other relevant things. We will be using NodeJS.

# Day 2

We'll introduce Databases, EasyTables, APIs and cover concepts such as testing, source control, security, BA skills and soft skills.

# Day 3

We will cover advanced matters such as integration with a website, and finish up our demo bot.
