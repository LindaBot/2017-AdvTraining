# Project Files

Hi guys, to run the project files first run 

```
npm -install
```
Inside of the directory with the contained files, so that the node modules files are installed, and then you can fiddle around with our API's and project.
Mind you that the get requests may not be working due to nulls inside the database! We will try to get this fixed but no promises.

All the best
